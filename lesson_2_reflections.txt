What happens when you initialize a rpository?  Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory and other meta data to prepare to track files. 
You have to start with the shell of a repository before you can add items to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is things that you have added before you commit.  It's a way to group things logically by commit.
