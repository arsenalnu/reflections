When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It might be faster, or easier to have a copy updated on the server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?You may not want changes from the remote repository creating havoc with the changes you're making locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is only on GitHub - and copies a repository to your area.  Clone copies from a remote (like GitHub) to your
computer.  Branch is for starting a new virtual area for making changes to the code that won't affect the other branches.
