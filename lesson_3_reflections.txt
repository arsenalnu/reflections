When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It might be faster, or easier to have a copy updated on the server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?You may not want changes from the remote repository creating havoc with the changes you're making locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is only on GitHub - and copies a repository to your area.  Clone copies from a remote (like GitHub) to your
computer.  Branch is for starting a new virtual area for making changes to the code that won't affect the other branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It maintains a snapshot of what the remote state looked like the last time you sync'd with it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We collaborate at work using cvs - but if you didn't have any version control, collaboration would have to be done
manually, which would be awful and error-prone.  Though you wouldn't have to learn any git commands or structure.
